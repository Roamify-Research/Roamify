  Travel planning often presents significant challenges and consumes considerable time. Existing LLM-powered tools, such as ChatGPT-4, suffer from limitations due to outdated training data. To address these shortcomings, we developed Roamify, an AI-driven itinerary planning plugin that streamlines the travel planning process by leveraging blog data and tailoring itineraries to individual user preferences. This paper presents Roamify's innovative methods, which transform vacation planning from a logistical burden into an exciting and personalized adventure. Through our user study, we identified three critical design considerations for future travel assistants: \textbf{D1)} integrating web scraping techniques to gather the latest news articles about a destination and incorporating them into itineraries, \textbf{D2)} aggregating attractions and ratings from diverse blog sources to enhance itinerary recommendations, and \textbf{D3)} leveraging user preferences to generate customized travel experiences. Our findings suggest that Roamify has the potential to revolutionize how users plan their trips, offering a more efficient and enjoyable process.

\section{Introduction}
In the past, travel was a luxury for the wealthy elite, but advancements in transportation have made it accessible to all. People now travel for various reasons—work, leisure, reunions, or exploration—creating a new challenge: deciding what to explore upon arrival. Traditionally, a family planning a vacation would rely on pre-arranged packages from travel agencies. However, the rise of online content, such as blogs and videos, has empowered travelers to plan their trips with greater flexibility and independence, moving away from conventional packages.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI research by paving the way for complex applications and software across diverse sectors. In tourism, LLMs hold immense potential to enhance the travel experience by incorporating personalized travel recommendations, dynamic itinerary planning, and customized travel content[1]. While LLMs are extensively used in the modern era, concerns have been raised regarding privacy issues, particularly the potential for data leaks and the recovery of sensitive user information from inputs[2]. This has created a need for solutions prioritizing generalization, ensuring that personal details such as names and other identifying information are not retained or exposed.

Building on the need for generalized, privacy-conscious solutions, Roamify, through its 'Roaming Redefined' initiative, harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to deliver a comprehensive platform for modern travel planning. Catering to a diverse audience—including youngsters, teenagers, college students, and families—Roamify tackles the common challenge of exploring new destinations without the burden of extensive planning. By employing LLMs, the application generates AI-driven itineraries with carefully curated personalized recommendations designed to protect user privacy.

Through comprehensive surveys and interviews, we gained valuable insights into potential users' travel planning habits and preferences. Our findings showed a clear preference for personalized and flexible travel options, particularly among young adults and professionals. Millennials and Generation Z favor AI-driven tools, while Generation X gravitates toward traditional travel agencies. Hence, it underscores the demand for a user-friendly, AI-powered travel solution such as Roamify, designed to cater to a wide range of age groups with a strong emphasis on personalization and efficiency.

To effectively understand the implications of AI-powered tools in the tourism industry, we guide this paper with the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1 - Involvement of user preferences:} What role do user preferences of genres like Historical, Amusement, Natural, and others play in planning travel itineraries?
    \item \textbf{RQ2 - Itinerary responses:} How effective and practical are the results obtained from the application?
    \item \textbf{RQ3 - Itinerary planning practices:} How do users currently approach itinerary planning, and in what ways does Roamify simplify and enhance this process by providing personalized, AI-driven travel recommendations?
\end{itemize}

By addressing these research questions, this paper aims to elucidate the methodology behind developing the Roamify application, explore its implications within the tourism industry, and consider future design considerations and potential impacts. Through this exploration, we intend to provide a comprehensive understanding of how AI-driven tools like Roamify can transform travel planning, highlighting such technology's current and future roles in enhancing user experiences.

\section{Related Work}

The application of Artificial Intelligence in the tourism industry has seen significant advancements, particularly with the advent of Large Language Models such as GPT-3 and GPT-4. These models have been utilized to enhance user experiences by providing personalized recommendations, itinerary planning, and real-time travel assistance. Several works have explored the potential and challenges of AI in this domain, focusing on the integration of user preferences, the reliability of AI-generated content, and the ethical implications of using AI in travel planning.

\subsection{AI-Powered Travel Assistants}
Research into AI-powered travel assistants has highlighted their potential to streamline travel planning by offering personalized recommendations and real-time assistance. For instance, Xu et al. (2020) developed an AI-based system for generating personalized travel itineraries using natural language processing techniques to analyze user preferences and destination data \cite{xu2020personalized}. Similarly, Yang et al. (2021) explored the application of LLMs in providing real-time travel information, emphasizing the importance of up-to-date data and user context in improving the accuracy of recommendations \cite{yang2021real}.

\subsection{Challenges of Outdated Data in LLMs}
Despite their potential, LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4 face significant challenges due to their reliance on pre-trained data, which may become outdated over time. Bender et al. (2021) and Bommasani et al. (2021) have pointed out that outdated data can lead to inaccurate or irrelevant recommendations, undermining the effectiveness of AI-driven travel assistants \cite{bender2021stochastic, bommasani2021opportunities}. These limitations have prompted researchers to explore methods for continuously updating LLMs with the latest information, as well as integrating external data sources such as web scraping to enhance the relevance and timeliness of AI-generated content.

\subsection{Web Scraping and Dynamic Content Integration}
Web scraping has emerged as a promising approach to addressing the limitations of static LLMs by dynamically integrating the latest information from various online sources. In the context of travel planning, this technique allows AI systems to provide users with the most current and relevant data, including recent blog posts, news articles, and user reviews. Li et al. (2022) demonstrated the effectiveness of web scraping in enhancing the accuracy of AI-generated travel recommendations by incorporating up-to-date content from a wide range of sources \cite{li2022enhancing}. Roamify builds on this approach by using web scraping to gather real-time data on destinations and attractions, ensuring that users receive the most relevant and personalized itinerary suggestions.

\subsection{Privacy Considerations in AI-Driven Travel Planning}
As AI continues to play an increasingly prominent role in travel planning, concerns around privacy and data security have become more pressing. Several studies have examined the risks associated with the use of LLMs, particularly regarding the potential for sensitive user information to be inadvertently exposed or misused. Brown et al. (2020) and Bommasani et al. (2021) emphasize the need for privacy-conscious AI solutions that prioritize data protection and minimize the retention of personally identifiable information \cite{brown2020language, bommasani2021opportunities}. Roamify addresses these concerns by adopting a generalization approach that ensures user data is anonymized and securely handled throughout the itinerary planning process.

\subsection{User-Centric Design in AI Travel Tools}
The importance of user-centric design in developing effective AI-powered travel tools has been widely recognized. Studies by Nguyen et al. (2019) and Kim et al. (2020) highlight the need to align AI-generated recommendations with user preferences and expectations to enhance the overall user experience \cite{nguyen2019user, kim2020design}. Roamify follows this principle by incorporating user preferences into the itinerary planning process, ensuring that the generated travel plans are not only accurate but also tailored to the individual needs and interests of each user.
